## GR_prop_fluc: A Python model for computing the variabile properties of relativistic discs
Main file is GR_prop_fluc.py, a Python implimentation of a model for computing the variabile properties of relativistic discs.  

This model was presented in the MNRAS Paper "Extending the theory of propagating fluctuations: the first fully 
relativistic treatment and analytical Fourier-Greenâ€™s functions", Andrew Mummery, 2023. 

### Python model
* Main function is GetVariableProperties(). 
* Returns hard and soft band power spectra, and the hard-soft cross spectrum. 
* Running GR_prop_fluc.py as main will produce figures similar to section 6 of the paper. 
* See code comments for further details.
